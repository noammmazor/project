              1.There are some things that are very important to understand,
              especially if this is your first dog!!
            </strong>
            <span>
              - Children don't always keep promises. Even if the children
              promised to take care of the dog and vowed that you wouldn't have
              to do anything, it won't be long until you find yourself taking
              care of the dog yourself. Children get bored, priorities change,
              they grow up and they won't be able to keep their promise. Don't
              bring a dog if you're not going to take care of it when kids are
              around. There will be a lot of broken hearts if you decide to
              return him, especially if the blame falls on them. It's a promise
              they can't keep and they're too young to understand it.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              -A dog is a commitment for the next 10-15 years. Are you living a
              clear routine for this time period? Do not bring a dog if you are
              not available to take care of it during this time. Of course it is
              possible and even desirable to adopt older dogs and then the
              responsibility will be at least time and you will save a wonderful
              soul. Old dogs are a hit!
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              -Dogs have character, what is character. And each of them is
              different from the other. Even in the litter of puppies, you can
              notice the difference between the puppies' character traits. Adult
              dogs develop personality also due to their past experience. Not
              every dog ​​is suitable for every family and the difference
              between a good match and a mismatch is huge. The conduct at home
              is completely different and most of the time incompatibility ends
              with the dog being taken out of the house. Making the right choice
              in advance will save you a lot of anxiety. It is important to
              understand that when a dog does not get what it needs, it learns
              problematic behaviors and when it is moved on, it takes these
              behaviors with it to the next home and the one after that.

            <strong>2.Should I adopt or buy?</strong>
            <span>
              - This is the first question you should ask. I will always
              recommend adopting first. There are thousands of dogs in
              associations of all ages and all sizes and you can find a
              wonderful match in these places as well. But, sometimes there is a
              very specific need. It is important for the dog to have a certain
              character, a certain type of fur (for those with allergies), maybe
              the appearance is important to us (this is also allowed), maybe it
              is important for me that the dog be therapeutic, maybe I raised
              this breed as a child and fell in love. There are many reasons why
              we might prefer a purebred dog. What is most important is to make
              sure that if we did decide to buy, only with certificates. It is
              very important. Racial without certificates is not racial
            </span>
            <strong>3.Is a puppy or a bug suitable for me??</strong>
            <span>
              -There are advantages and disadvantages to each such choice. A
              puppy is a smooth page and you can raise him and get him used to
              the things that are important to us from the beginning. And a
              puppy is the cutest there is. On the other hand, a puppy is work.
              A lot of work. It's cleaning needs for a few months, it's managing
              the environment correctly, dealing with mischief and biting. It's
              really not easy and not suitable if you want a dog that will
              integrate relatively quickly into your home life. If you have
              patience and more free time, a puppy can definitely fit into this
              joint journey.
              <br />
              -By adopting an adult dog, you get a dog that is relatively stable
              in its behavior. for better and for worse. Of course it is always
              possible to change, help, restore, teach, develop, connect.
              Adopting an adult dog from an association can be misleading. Dogs
              in the association will not necessarily behave in the association
              as they would at home. Therefore, the description you will receive
              there will not necessarily be what you will receive from the dog.
              You can find a dog from a family that is adopted and get a better
              idea of ​​its domestic nature. If you work most of the day and are
              away from home, it is better to bring an adult dog (but not
              necessarily, you can always manage with a dog walker or boarding
              houses in the area until the dog is older){" "}
            </span>
            <strong>4.our living environment??</strong>
            <span>
              Do we live in a quiet place or a noisy and busy place? Sensitive
              or fearful dogs will have a harder time living in a crowded city
              but can thrive in a home with a yard. Sociable dogs can enjoy
              playing with the neighborhood dogs every evening. It is very
              important to think about how the specific dog we want will get
              along with our living environment.
            </span>

            />
            <br />
            <strong>5.The energy level of the household members</strong>
            <span>
              Are you the get-up-and-go type or are you more Netflix and chill?
              If you are active people and you want the dog to join you on your
              travels, you should take an energetic, sporty dog ​​that can keep
              up with you. Just remember that such a dog is energetic all the
              time, not just once a month when you go for a walk. You will have
              to drain him of energy regularly. If you're more on the calm side,
              you should find a dog with lower energies that won't drive you
              crazy with excess energy (it's important to remember that puppies
              are always energetic. This passes to most of them in adulthood,
              except for energetic ones). If you like to go for a walk every
              evening, you should find a dog with an average energy level. Not
              lazy but not very active either.
            </span>
            <strong>6.The size of the dog</strong>
            <span>
              In terms of size, you can start by following your personal
              preference. The size of the dog does not determine its character,
              so you can find dogs with the perfect character for you in any
              size. Yes there are things to think about like will children have
              to travel with it? If so, it's better to go for a small dog that
              won't be able to knock them off. Do you live in an area with a
              population that is afraid of dogs? You may find it difficult to
              annoying to walk with a large dog. Does the dog come to give
              reassurance? In this case a large dog can be very suitable. And of
              course, think about what will be the most fun for you to cuddle
              with at night.

        <strong>*important:</strong>
          <span className="card p-2">
            These are the most important considerations when choosing a dog.
            Compatibility is extremely important. Do not choose the most
            beautiful dog even though it is very tempting. He will look much
            less beautiful to you when he drives you crazy at home because he
            just doesn't suit you. Improper adjustment is one of the main
            reasons why dogs end up wandering from house to house and end their
            lives in the association. There are ways to test a dog's character.
            Although this is not 100 percent accurate, dogs behave differently
            at home and in the association and in general, dogs behave
            differently in different environments. But it can give us a good
            idea at all about the dog's inner character.
