          Benefits Of Fresh Dog Food: 10 Research-Backed Reasons To Switch

          Have you heard about fresh food as an option for your pup but don’t
          know the benefits?

        <p>
          Are you considering switching to a freshly prepared dog food? If so,
          veterinary research says you’re making the right move. Fresh dog food,
          formulated as part of a balanced diet, can have a great impact on your
          dog’s health, wellness, and even his lifespan. When it comes to
          keeping your pup healthy and energized, simply choosing a commercial
          dog food with “wholesome!” on the label may seem like enough.
          Unfortunately, it’s not quite that simple. “Just because a dog food is
          labeled ‘holistic’ or ‘all-natural’ doesn’t mean it’s necessarily any
          better than anything else out there,” says Andi Brown, author of The
          Whole Pet Diet and a pioneer of holistic pet products. Here’s what
          those misleading dog food labels really mean.
        </p>
        <h2>REASONS TO GIVE FRESH FOOD FOR YOUR DOG</h2>
        <p>
          There are many reasons to get a dog. Here’s some of our favorites!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Helps prevent medical conditions</strong>
        </p>
        <span>
          {" "}
          Many commercial dog foods made in pet food plants, on the other hand,
          contain super-low-quality ingredients—stuff rejected for human
          consumption. Says Brown: “Why was it rejected? Well, the animal came
          to the slaughterhouse dying or disabled, or the grains are dirty from
          falling on the floor and can’t be used in human plants, so they’re
          immediately sent to the pet food plants. They’re garbage.” And when
          you couple inferior ingredients in your the commercial dog food diet
          with dyes, fillers, preservatives, and synthetic vitamins, “you’re
          setting the pet’s body up for warfare,” she says. “They have to battle
          those foods just to process them.”

          <strong>2. Can be used to keep your dog at a healthy weight</strong>
        </p>
        <span>
          Balanced diets, like the ones formulated by Ollie, prevent excessive
          weight gain and ensure every bite of your pup’s food is packed with
          good nutrition—no fillers needed. On the other hand, if you have a dog
          who is underweight, Ollie can help your pup put on those much needed
          pounds in a healthy way. So how does commercial dog food lead to
          weight gain? Simple: It’s too heavy on starches, Brown explains. “Many
          pet foods contain fillers so that the manufacturers can make more
          money; corn, wheat, rice, potatoes are very inexpensive,” she says.
          “It’s exactly the same as for humans: A diet heavy on starches leads
          to weight gain.”
        </span>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Increases your dog’s lifespan</strong>
        </p>
        <span>
          In one paper, dogs fed a fresh diet lived for 13.1 years, on average,
          while those fed commercial, canned dog food reached an average of 10.4
          years. That’s an extra two and a half years you and your dog could
          spend together! So, yes, what you feed your dog can have a positive
          impact on how long they live. The starch, dyes, preservatives, and
          synthetic nutrients in many commercial dog foods eventually take a
          toll on a pup’s health, Brown explains. “People could live on potato
          chips and beer alone, but not long or well,” she points out. “It’s the
          same thing with animals on a commercial diet—sooner or later, it
          catches up with them.
        </span>
        <p>
          <strong>4. Improves digestive health</strong>
        </p>
        <span>
          A mix of vegetables and meat is critical for a dog to maintain a
          healthy gut. Think of it this way: Out in the wild, a dog would take
          down a small animal—say, a rabbit, bird, or squirrel—and consume the
          contents of the prey’s stomach, too, Brown explains. The small animals
          are generally herbivores, so the dog would be consuming meat, plus
          vegetables that provide nutrients and fiber, which helps keep the
          digestive system humming smoothly.
          <br />

        </span>
        <p>
          <strong>5. Helps your dog have better poop</strong>
        </p>
        <span>
          One thing that pet parents who feed Ollie consistently report is that
          their pups are pooping better! By feeding whole foods like you find in
          our delicious fresh dog food, dogs have better and smaller poops. The
          same fiber that helps keep your dog’s digestive system moving along a
          is also responsible for this phenomenon.
        </span>
        <p>
          <strong>6. Higher quality sleep</strong>
        </p>
        <span>
          Another surprising side effect of a healthy digestive system: Your dog
          will sleep better at night. “If your animal gets up in the middle of
          the night, sighing, breathing, switching positions, that’s a sign that
          the digestive system is upset,” Brown says. “When you’re putting the
          right ingredients into the body in proper proportions, the dog’s rest
          is pure and restorative.” Just like you after a good night’s
          sleep—your dog will feel better and be healthier overall if they are
          getting a good night’s sleep. Just like you after a good night’s
          sleep—your dog will feel better and be healthier overall if they are

        </span>
        <p>
          <strong>7. Improves cognitive function</strong>
        </p>
        <span>
          A healthy diet can actually improve cognitive function in dogs. In one
          study in The Journal of Veterinary Medicine, old, cognitively impaired
          dogs who were fed an antioxidant-enriched diet had higher levels of
          brain-derived neurotrophic factors, which may slow cognitive decline.
          The logic is analogous to how a diet rich in antioxidants (i.e.,
          fresh, colorful produce) seems to help prevent cognitive decline in
          humans. Even in younger dogs, a fresh, wholesome diet fuels learning
          and alertness, Brown adds. “When you feel good, you’re sharper, you
          have more energy, and you can tackle more tasks,” she says.

        </span>
        <p>
          <strong>9. Fuels exercise and helps your pup recover.</strong>
        </p>
        <span>
          Getting enough exercise is critically important for dogs of all ages.
          While there are many great ways to exercise from simply walking
          through your neighborhood to competing in dog sports like Rally and
          Agility, your pup will need lots of good fuel to carry them through
          their workouts.
        </span>
        <p>
          <strong>10. Can help your pup overcome picky eating.</strong>
        </p>
        <span>
          If you have a picky pup, fresh food can help you get your pup to enjoy
          eating more. While for some dog owners it is impossible to believe
          that there are pups who turn up their nose at anything, others may be
          crying in the pet food aisle begging for something their pup will
          eat.Fresh food helps with picky eating for a number of reasons
          depending on why a pup is picky. For older pups who have trouble
          crunching kibble – the soft texture of the fresh food may be
          appealing.
