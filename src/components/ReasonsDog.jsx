          Whether you just got your first place and are new to living alone, or
          you’ve got a family but feel like something is missing, you need a dog
          in your life! While they are a lot of work (taking them outside
          multiple times a day, ensuring they go to the vet regularly, feeding
          them on time, etc.), they’re also a huge reward and joy to have in
          life. Here are all the reasons you should get a dog, plus a handy list
          of everything you’ll need to ensure you and your new pet are happy!
        </p>
        <h2>REASONS TO GET A DOG</h2>
        <p>
          There are many reasons to get a dog. Here’s some of our favorites!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Dogs make you more active.</strong>
        </p>
        <span>
          {" "}
          Because dogs are highly energetic and require daily walks, they make
          you more active. If you live somewhere without a fenced in backyard,
          you’ll need to put your pup on a leash and walk them at least around
          the block. The added cardio from walking your dog is a great way to
          get more active – and you won’t even realize it until a few months in!
          Because you’ll be spending much more time being active, trade out your
          metal bands{" "}

        <p>
          {" "}
          <strong>
            2. Dogs are natural treatments for depression and anxiety
          </strong>
        </p>
        <span>
          " While any pet can be classified as an emotional support animal (ESA,
          for short), dogs are particularly suited for helping in treating
          mental health issues. Dogs have been known to signal happy chemicals
          in our brains, " after being around them for less than an hour. And
          who doesn’t want to feel happy all the time? Getting a dog will ensure
          you feel great all throughout the day whenever you’re around it
        </span>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Dogs are a great source of comfort</strong>
        </p>
        <span>
          " When you have a bad day or aren’t feeling well, a dog is a great
          companion. They’re more than content to just lay around with you. In
          fact, that’s probably one of their favorite things to do! Whether you
          just lay with them on the couch or cuddle up with them in bed while
          you binge-watch your favorite TV show, a dog is a constant companion
          and great source of comfort. They’ll nuzzle right up to you and make
          you feel better, no matter the circumstances."
        </span>
        <p>
          <strong>4. Dogs are good for your social life.</strong>
        </p>
        <span>
          When you have a dog, you have to take it out for walks. Those walks
          then translate into trips to the beach, going hiking or even going on
          a road trip! Either way, dogs are good for your social life because
          you’re sure to come across other people and even other dog owners
          while taking your pupper to all these places. Whether you go to the
          dog park or the vet, you’re sure to meet lots of new friends all
          because of your dog.

        </span>
        <p>
          <strong>5. Dogs are good for your romantic life, too!</strong>
        </p>
        <span>
          When meeting all these new people because of your dog, who’s to say
          you won’t meet your special someone, too? Of course, if you’ve already
          met your person and have a beautiful family with them, this one might
          not apply as much to you – but dogs are such good mood boosters that
          adding one to the family can’t hurt how you feel about your special
          someone!
        </span>
        <p>
          <strong>6. Dogs increase your responsibility.</strong>
        </p>
        <span>
          "Dogs are great at teaching you responsibility. You are now
          responsible for an entire other being. You have to ensure the dog gets
          fed properly, is healthy, goes to the vet when it’s supposed to, is
          groomed consistently and goes on daily walks. You have to dog-proof
          your home to ensure the dog doesn’t get into anything and destroy your
          personal items or get hurt. No one else is responsible for the health
          and safety of your dog besides you – and that’s a huge responsibility.
          If you weren’t responsible before getting a dog, you definitely will
          be afterwards!"
        </span>
        <p>
          <strong>7. Dogs know when you’re sick…and can help us heal!</strong>
        </p>
        <span>
          " Your dog’s snout can sense out the changes in your body chemistry
          when you're not feeling well. Sometimes, it happens before you even
          start to feel any symptoms! Dogs can be trained to "", including
          cancer. Having a dog around can definitely ensure you stay happy and
          healthy for many years to come."
          <br />

        </span>
        <p>
          <strong>9. Dogs teach children responsibility.</strong>
        </p>
        <span>
          If you have kids, adding a dog to the mix is a great idea! Your kids
          will learn about feeding the dog, taking it out for walks, ensuring it
          stays healthy and grooming it. All of these are important aspects of
          responsibility they’re never too young to learn! For many kids, they
          won’t even realize all the work they’re doing because they’ll enjoy it
          so much. The protein in fresh food provides great energy for your pup
          so they feel good while they exercise. It can also help with recovery.
          By feeding the right mix of whole foods, your dog will be able to be
          the athlete (or walking companion) you’ve always wanted them to be!
        </span>
        <p>
          <strong>10. Dogs are family.</strong>
        </p>
        <span>
          When you get a dog, you’re adding to your family. Dogs instantly
          become a part of your familial unit. They’re practically like adding
          another kid! Dogs bring joy and happiness to every household. You can
          do so much with them because they love to be around people! Adding a
          dog to the mix will ensure your home is never lacking in cuddles or
          funny moments. Sure, every once in a while they’ll destroy a pillow,
          but it’s all in good fun and love.
